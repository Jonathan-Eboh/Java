//For a binary search to work the data must first be SORTED----if it not sorted you must use a linear search

// divide and conquer approach


//1) give initial values to the range
	//P = 0, r = arr.length - 1
//2) while P <= r do..
	//a) set q = Math.floor((P+r)/2) this gives midpoint we floor so we can catch any floats because indicies are all integers
	//b) if the value we are looking for is located at arr[q] (in the middle of the array) then we just return q
	//c) if arr[q] > x then x is in the first half...which means that r now = q-1
		//else arr[q] < x then leave r where it is and change P to be q+1

//3) return -1 couldnt find the value we were seaching for in this array
