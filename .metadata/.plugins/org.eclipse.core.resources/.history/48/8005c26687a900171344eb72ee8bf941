//Given two string, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

//Key words, need to make sure a string is a permutation of the one its compared to because of this casing will matter
// define what it means to be a permutation:
// -1 the two strings are of equal length
// -2 the two strings contain the same characters in any order allowed by the factorial of the string length

//1) first thing we can do off the bat is compare the lengths of the two strings, if there are different just return false
//2) if they get past that check
