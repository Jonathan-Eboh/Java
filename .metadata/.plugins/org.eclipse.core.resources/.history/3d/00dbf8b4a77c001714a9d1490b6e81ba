//Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

// Key word in this problem is characters. Don't need to worry about checking for upper and lower case relative to uniqueness (as in something like C and c is allowed) because upper and lower case have different ASCII values

//1) iterate through string
//2) grab individual char from string
//3)check every char in the string against the current char
//4) if nothing is the same as the char then reture true
//5) otherwise return false
